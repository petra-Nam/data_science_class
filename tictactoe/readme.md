A simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts & Crosses) game implemented in Python.
Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the board is full (tie).

🚀 How to Play
Run the Python script in your terminal.
The board will be displayed with coordinates:
Rows: 0, 1, 2
Columns: 0, 1, 2
On your turn, enter the row and column where you want to place your mark (X or O).
The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
If the board fills up with no winner, the game ends in a tie.
